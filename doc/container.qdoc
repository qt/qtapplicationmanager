\brief Describes an execution environment for an executable.

In the application manager context, a \b container describes an execution environment for an
executable: either an application's binary or its runtime binary, in multi-process mode. The
container does not have to be something sophisticated like a Docker container, but can be as
simple as a Unix process.

\section1 Predefined Containers

The application manager comes with one built-in container type: the \c process container,
that spawns a new Unix process to execute the requested binary.

In addition, you can find a basic integration of Pelagicore's
\l{https://github.com/Pelagicore/softwarecontainer}{SoftwareContainer} in \c
examples/applicationmanager/softwarecontainer-plugin. For more information, see
\l{SoftwareContainer Plugin Example}. This example can be used as a blueprint to either create a
customer-specific production version of a SoftwareContainer plugin, or to integrate another
container solution.

\section1 Extend with Container Plugins

Custom container solutions can be added via plugins. These plugins need not to be built as part
of the application manager, but they need to be built against a private Qt module to get the
interface definition:

Here's a snippet on how to do this with cmake:
\badcode
...
find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS AppManPluginInterfacesPrivate)
qt_add_plugin(mycontainer-plugin)
target_link_libraries(mycontainer-plugin PUBLIC Qt::AppManPluginInterfacesPrivate)
...
\endcode

Here's the qmake version:

\badcode
...
TEMPLATE = lib
CONFIG += plugin
TARGET = mycontainer-plugin

QT += appman_plugininterfaces-private
...
\endcode

Then, you only have to implement two classes that derive from \l ContainerInterface
and from \l ContainerManagerInterface respectively:

\code
#include <QtAppManPluginInterfaces/containerinterface.h>

class SoftwareContainer : public ContainerInterface
{
    // ...
};

class SoftwareContainerManager : public QObject, public ContainerManagerInterface
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID AM_ContainerManagerInterface_iid)
    Q_INTERFACES(ContainerManagerInterface)

    // ....
};
\endcode

Be aware that your container plugin has to support a few basic requirements to support UI clients
in multi-process mode:
\list 1
  \li The plugin has to be able to forward Unix local sockets into the container. This is needed
      for both the \l{Qt Wayland Compositor}{Wayland} socket as well as for the private peer-to-peer
      D-Bus connection. If the plugin cannot map these sockets to the correct location within the
      container, the plugin then needs to modify the environment variables for the respective
      locations before passing them on to the container. The table below lists the relevant
      environment variables.
  \li To support hardware OpenGL acceleration, the container needs to have access to the necessary
      devices. For GPUs that follow Linux standards, such as Intel, make sure to have
      \c{/dev/dri/*} available within the container.
  \li You have to implement PID mapping in your plugin; unless your container solution shares its
      PID namespace with the rest of the system. This is necessary if you want to make use of the
      application manager's security features. Each connection coming into the application manager
      via the Wayland or D-Bus Unix local sockets is queried for the PID of the application that
      requests the connection. The application manager verifies these PIDs against the PIDs of all
      running applications via ContainerInterface::processId(). Connections that don't match a PID
      are not accepted. However, you can disable this behavior via the
      \l{no-security}{\c{--no-security}} command line option.
\endlist

The application manager uses the following environment variables to communicate various settings to
the application. A custom container plugin must forward these variables or adjust them accordingly:

\table
\header
  \li Name
  \li Description
\row
  \li \c{WAYLAND_DISPLAY}
  \li The path to the Wayland server socket. If your container uses its own filesystem namespace,
      make sure that this socket is forwarded accordingly.
\row
  \li \c{QT_QPA_PLATFORM}
  \li Always set to \c{wayland}.
\row
  \li \c{QT_IM_MODULE}
  \li Not set, but explicitly unset by the application manager. Make sure to leave it unset, to
      use the automatic Wayland input method implementation.
\row
  \li \c{QT_SCALE_FACTOR}
  \li Empty (unset), to prevent scaling of wayland clients relative to the compositor. Otherwise
      running the application manager on a 4K desktop with scaling would result in double-scaled
      applications within the application manager.
\row
  \li \c{QT_WAYLAND_SHELL_INTEGRATION}
  \li Set to \c{xdg-shell}. This is the preferred wayland shell integration.
\row
  \li \c{DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS}
  \li The standard D-Bus session bus.
\row
  \li \c{AM_CONFIG}
  \li A YAML, UTF-8 string encoded version of the \l{amConfigDetails}{amConfig} map.
\row
  \li \c{AM_NO_DLT_LOGGING}
  \li Tells the application to not use DLT for logging, if set to \c 1.
\endtable

\section1 Configuration

A container configuration has three parts:

\list 1
  \li Configure which containers are available when \l{load-plugins}{loading} the container plugins
  \li Add specific settings for each \l{container-integration}{container integration} available
  \li Configure which container solution to \l{container-selection}{select} to run a specific
      application
\endlist

\target load-plugins
\section1 Load Container Plugins

To configure an existing container plugin for use in the application manager, you need to
add its full path to the list of plugins to load in the application manager's config file:

\badcode
plugins:
  container: [ "/full/path/to/softwarecontainers.so", "/another/plugin.so" ]
\endcode

\note The application manager does \b not load plugins automatically if they are placed
in a specific directory. This is because container plugins control the central security mechanism for
separating applications.

\target container-integration
\section1 Add Container Integration Settings

Each container integration has a unique ID, which can be used to add settings to the
application manager's config file, such as:

\badcode
containers:
  process:
    defaultControlGroup: "foo"
  softwarecontainers:
    bar: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
\endcode

The \c process container accepts the following configuration settings:

\table
  \header
    \li Settings Name
    \li Type
    \li Description
  \row
    \li \c controlGroups
    \li object
    \target control group mapping
    \li A two-stage mapping object to allow for more readable code when dealing with \c cgroups
        from the System UI via Container::controlGroup. The top-level \c keys are readable group names
        that are used to interface with Container::controlGroup. The values themselves are \c maps
        between multiple low-level \c cgroup sub-system names and the actual \c cgroup names within
        those sub-systems, such as:

    \badcode
    controlGroups:
      foreGround:
        memory: mem1
        cpu: cpu_full
      backGround:
        memory: mem2
        cpu: cpu_minimal
    \endcode

  \row
    \li \c defaultControlGroup
    \li string
    \li The default control group for an application when it is first launched.
\endtable

For other container plugins, refer to their respective documentation.

\target container-selection
\section1 Container Selection Configuration

When you start an application from within the application manager, there are multiple ways to
control which container integration is used:

\list 1
  \li If the config file does not contain the \c containers/selection key, the container
      integration ID defaults to \c process.
  \li If the \c containers/selection key exists, its contents are parsed as a list of maps, where
      each map has a single mapping only. While this single mapping is awkward, it is necessary to
      preserve the order of the mappings. Each key is interpreted as a standard Unix wildcard
      expression that is matched against the application ID. The first match stops the algorithm
      and the mapping's value is used as the container integration ID. If no matches are found,
      the resulting container integration ID is an empty string.

    \badcode
    containers:
      selection:
      - com.pelagicore.*: "process"
      - com.navigation: "special-container"
      - '*': "softwarecontainers"  # a single asterisk needs to be quoted
    \endcode

  \li Afterwards, if the System UI did set the ApplicationManager::containerSelectionFunction
      property to a valid JavaScript function, this function is called with the first parameter set
      to the application's ID and the second parameter set to the container integration ID that
      resulted from step 1 and 2.

    \badcode
    ApplicationManager.containerSelectionFunction = function(appId, containerId) {
        var app = ApplicationManager.application(appId)
        if (app.capabilities.indexOf("non-secure") != -1)
            return "process"
        else
            return containerId
    }
    \endcode
\endlist
