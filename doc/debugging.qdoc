\title Logging and Debugging

\section1 Logging

The application manager installs its own message handler to format logging output neatly. If the
\l{Qt GENIVI Extras}{QtGeniviExtras} module is available, this message handler passes the output
to GENIVI Diagnostic Log and Trace (DLT).

\section2 Categories

The application manager defines the following logging categories:

\include logging.cpp am-logging-categories

\section2 Environment Variables

This is a (incomplete) list of environment variables that influence the logging output at runtime:

\table
\header
    \li Variable
    \li Description
\row
    \li AM_STARTUP_TIMER
    \li If set to 1, a startup performance analysis is printed on the console. Anything other than
        1 is interpreted as the name of a file to use, instead of the console. For more
        information, see StartupTimer.
\row
    \li AM_FORCE_COLOR_OUTPUT
    \li Can be set to \c on to force color output to the console or to \c off to disable it. Any
        other value results in the default, auto-detection behavior.
\row
    \li AM_TIMEOUT_FACTOR
    \li An integer factor that slows down all timed wait statements within the application manager.
    Useful if running in slow wrappers, such as Valgrind. The default value is \c 1.
\row
    \li QT_MESSAGE_PATTERN
    \li Setting this variable has the same effect as described in
        \l{Warning and Debugging Messages}{Debugging Techniques} and overwrites the default
        application manager message handler. Parallel DLT logging is still supported, if available.
\endtable

\section1 Debugging

\section2 Introduction

When debugging the application manager, the System UI and applications are dependent on the mode in
which the application manager runs:

\list
\li In \b single-process mode, you can start the \c appman binary using any debugging tool
    directly, for example, \c{gdb --args appman -c config.yaml}. Since everything runs in a single
    process, you can't debug applications separately. Instead, all applications started are loaded
    into \b{a single process}, so you can only debug the entire process at once; not each
    application independently.

\li In \b multi-process mode, you have to distinguish between debugging the application manager
    itself or the System UI and debugging individual applications: The application manager and
    System UI can be debugged in the same way as for a single-process setup above. Debugging
    is a bit more tricky for applications, as they have to be started by the application manager.
    You can accomplish this by running the application through a debug wrapper which describes
    how to start an application using your favorite debugging tool.
\endlist

To enable QML Debugging or QML Profiling in the application manager or an application, start it
with the \c --qml-debug argument. For more information, see \l{QML Debugging Infrastructure}.

\note Although the concept is called "debug" wrappers, these wrappers are not limited to debugging
tasks only. They are also useful for various other tasks that involve running the application under
test through a wrapper, like profiling tools.

\target DebugWrappers
\section2 Use Debug Wrappers

There are three ways to start applications using debug wrappers - all of them rely on a common way
to specify which debug wrapper to use:

\list
\li Within your System UI, use \c debugApplication to start an application, instead of
    \c startApplication:
    \badcode
    ApplicationManager.debugApplication("io.qt.app", "/usr/bin/strace -f")
    \endcode
\li Via D-Bus, you can call the debugApplication method:
    \badcode
    qdbus io.qt.ApplicationManager /ApplicationManager debugApplication "gdbserver :5555" io.qt.app
    \endcode
\li Using the \c appman-controller which uses D-Bus internally, but is able to find the correct
    bus automatically and supports standard-IO redirection:
    \badcode
    appman-controller debug-application -ioe "valgrind --tool=helgrind" io.qt.app
    \endcode
    The optional \c -i, \c -o, and \c -e parameters redirect the respective IO streams (\c stdin,
    \c stdout, and \c stderr) to the calling terminal.
\endlist

\note To use the D-Bus options, the application manager has to be connected to either a session- or
system-bus; don't run it with \c{--dbus none}.

The debug wrapper specification has to be a single argument string, that is interpreted as a
command line. If this string contains the \c{%program%} sub-string, it is replaced with the full
path to the application's executable (or the \c appman-launcher-qml binary for QML applications).
The same thing happens for \c{%arguments%}, which is replaced with potential command line arguments
for the application. If you don't specify \c{%program%} or \c{%arguments%}, they are appended to
the resulting command line.

This means that all of these debug wrappers are essentially the same:
\badcode
appman-controller debug-application "gdbserver :5555 %program% %arguments%" io.qt.music
appman-controller debug-application "gdbserver :5555 %program%" io.qt.music
appman-controller debug-application "gdbserver :5555" io.qt.music
\endcode

The explicit \c{%program%} argument is important, if the "wrapper" works differently. An example
for this would be to start the application with the JavaScript debugger on port 1234 in blocking
mode:
\badcode
appman-controller debug-application "%program% -qmljsdebugger=port:1234,block %arguments%" io.qt.browser
\endcode

You can also specify environment variables for the debug wrapper - just like on the command line.
This command runs your application through \c strace while also setting the \c WAYLAND_DEBUG
environment variable to \c 1.
\badcode
appman-controller debug-application "WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 strace -f" io.qt.browser
\endcode
For added convenience, you can even set environment variables only, without any actual debug
wrapper, to debug imports and plugin loading in a QML application:
\badcode
appman-controller debug-application "QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1 QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1" io.qt.browser
\endcode

When using complex debug wrappers on the command line often, it's advisable to create aliases or
wrapper scripts.
