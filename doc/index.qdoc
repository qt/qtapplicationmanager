\title Qt Application Manager

\section1 Overview

The application manager binary (\c appman) is a headless daemon by itself. You need to supply a
suitable QML file via the command-line or via a config file at startup, which then acts as a
compositing window manager using the APIs that are exported from the C++ side.

For a high-level overview, see \l{The Qt Application Manager}{Introduction to the Qt Application Manager}.
