Abstract
========
The appman-prompt script provides command completion inside a bash shell for
the appman executable, appman-controller and appman-packager commands.

Installation
============
As a prerequisite the bash-completion package needs not be installed. The
appman-prompt script itself can be installed in one of the following ways:

1. Copy appman-prompt into the /etc/bash_completion.d folder
   (or whatever "pkg-config --variable=compatdir bash-completion" yields)

2. Copy the contents of appman-prompt into the ~/.bash_completion file

Afterwards completion will be available in new shells.

Notes
=====
(Sub-)Command options for the appman-controller and appman-packager are
currently not supported, only the general ones (help and version).

Users of the zsh shell might want to run the following commands to get going:
autoload bashcompinit
bashcompinit
source /etc/bash_completion.d/appman-prompt
